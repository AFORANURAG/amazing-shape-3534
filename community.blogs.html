            <p>We know it’s important for the body to be fueled throughout the day and especially prior to exercise.
               Ensuring muscles get the right amount of protein and carbohydrate post workout, though, aid in recovery
               and muscle growth.</p>

            <p>More than 42 percent of adults in the U.S. have obesity. We continue to hear that it’s a “growing”
               concern. Obviously these last few pandemic years have not helped that. Knowing nineteen states now have
               adult obesity rates over 35 percent, up from 16 states last year, may just justify that concern.</p>

            <p>There are many different cardio exercises to choose from when trying to construct a workout. One of the
               best overall movements you can perform, though, is rowing. There is a reason why every CrossFit around
               the country has multiple ergs at their facility. From whatever stance you want to take, this exercise
               always comes out on top.</p>
